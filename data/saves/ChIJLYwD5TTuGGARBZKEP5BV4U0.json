Being able to come here the second time 2 years later with a 2pm ticket time was something I was completely looking forward too. Getting a ticket through the Lawson was a blood bath but keep trying! It took my friend and I at least 40 min to finally get through to the payment screen to check out. Set your alarm clocks and keep trying. You have to book in advance right as tickets are released. Arriving at 2pm gave me a lot of time to be able to look through each exhibit at my leisure along with being able to enjoy the cafe. If there's a long wait at the cafe, go closer towards closing and the wait time will go down significantly. In the mean time, I  recommend getting the egg rolls from the food window on the side of the cafe along with the two Ghibli beers they have available. I really enjoyed the beers and loved the thought they put into the label! It's so cute! Also get the soft serve, both flavors are also very good. To get there, there's a Ghibli bus that goes directly to the Ghibli Museum at Mitaka Station.",

Other than that, it's Ghibli, you can't go wrong about the content. Ah and you can't take pictures, which makes sense because it is packed enough without people in the middle of the room taking pictures.",

They show the steps of creating some of the animations, how they paid the cells, and wonderful exhibits on how motion is created using still images and figures. The short movie they show at the museum was really cute and worth it.\n\nYou must book in advance (month before if you are overseas) and they sell out quick so you better be on top of it! No pictures inside.\n\nAlso your entrance ticket is literally 3 frames from one of the movies!",
