The food was really good, however I wish they had more vegetarian options. There was also a show during the time we went which was pretty interesting to watch!",

Entertainment is just amazing.\n\nDrinks are good as well - booked all you can drink.\n\nWe paid 160€ for 2 persons - an amazing evening so far. Easily worth the money!\n\nEdit1: and dessert as well. :)",

Great decorations and atmosphere, pretty decent food, a show, spacious, a decent adult drink menu and tasty drinks for the kids, friendly staff. If you promised the family to go to a theme restaurant on your Tokyo trip, skip all the other ones (unlike me *sigh*) and come here. Yes, it's pricey. But not really more so than other restaurants and certainly not other theme restaurants. And you only live once so maximize the value of the joy it will bring to those in your family who like this sort of thing and go here. My daughter was enraptured. And that's priceless. Skip the other hellholes like this though. And, like I said, I hate these kinds of places, but this is the best of those kinds of places. Love your kids, people. Make them happy. Spend $25 a head on this experience.",

We did order their \"Colorful Poison Parfait\" which was much better than expected, especially after all the reviews about their okay to bad food. It was packed with different and distinct flavors if you take the time to eat it bit by bit. \nThe host was definitely entertaining throughout the show and did not seem to shun anyone when not on stage. The girls- well one had her routine down to match her physique, while the other 2 still have room to master their routine. That said none of the girls were bad. Ordering a straight whiskey would not be my recommendation as it was quite watered down to the point of tasting bad. The highball was okay and the beer was better than expected [not water down] but not as good as Asahi or the like.",

Supposedly there's a 90 min time limit but we were here for 3 hours. Food was cold and we had to call the server for each course because the surrounding tables who came long after us were getting served before us. They also told us the blue burgers were sold out but those later tables all were able to get burgers. The initial fun only lasts for the first 15-20 minutes.",
